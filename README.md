## Description

Our Personal Finance Tracker is a web application meant to assist users in managing their finances. The application will help users:

- Log in securely and manage their personal profiles
- Set and update budgets
- Track their expenses
- View remaining budgets and total expenses
- Predict next monthâ€™s expenses based on historical data using a built-in machine learning model

It's built with Python and Flask. The application utilizes a MongoDB database to securely store user data and transaction histories. It's also containerized using Docker, making sure there's consistent deployment across differing environments. We also have unit tests included to maintain code quality and reliability.

## Subsystems

Outside of MongoDB, this project consists of two main subsystems:

1. **Backend**:
   - Flask-based and for user authentication, financial data management, and machine learning predictions
   - Interacts with a MongoDB database to store user and transaction data
   - Fully containerized with its own `Dockerfile` and an integrated CI/CD pipeline

2. **Frontend**:
   - A Flask app serving a user-friendly interface
   - Proxies API requests to the backend for seamless integration
   - Includes interactive forms and modals for updating budgets and managing expenses

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. Install Docker and Docker Compose.
2. Ensure MongoDB is running locally or available as a service.


### Running the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/software-students-fall2024/5-final-super-awesome-team-name-2.git
   cd 5-final-super-awesome-team-name-2
   ```

2. Build and run the Docker containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. Access the application:


## Starter Data

To initialize the database with starter data:
1. Run the backend container and access its shell:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it backend-container-name bash
   ```
2. Execute the following script:
   ```python
   from backend.database import Database
   db = Database()
   db._ensure_default_user()
   ```
