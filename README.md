# Product Vision Statement
WEARther is a web-based application that combines weather data and curated outfit recommendations to provide a seamless user experience. 

## **Description**
**WEARther** uses real-time weather data to suggest gender-specific clothing options suitable for the current temperature and conditions. Unlike generic weather apps or static fashion guides, our product delivers a dynamic and location-specific outfit suggestion system, integrated with an intuitive, user-friendly interface and robust backend powered by Dockerized services.

---

## **Features**
- User Authentication (Login/Registration)
- Location-based weather data retrieval via OpenWeather API
- Outfit suggestions based on gender and temperature ranges
- Fully responsive user interface
- Dockerized architecture for seamless deployment

### **Running the Project**
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/software-students-fall2024/5-final-java_and_the_scripts_1.git
    cd 5-final-java_and_the_scripts_1
    ```
2. Build and start the Docker containers:
    ```bash
        docker-compose up --build --force-recreate
    ```
3. Access the web app:
    - Open your browser and navigate to ` http://localhost:5002/login`.

---

### **Accessing the App**
- **Register a new user** via the `/register` route.
- **Log in** via the `/login` route.
- **Add a location** and view outfit recommendations via the `/locations` route.

- **`test_app.py`**: Unit tests for the Flask app, including tests for weather data retrieval and route functionality.
- **`test_popdatabase.py`**: Unit tests for verifying the population of the MongoDB database with outfit data based on temperature ranges.
- **`popdatabase.py`**: Script for populating the database with outfits. Currently includes commented logic for inserting sample data into MongoDB.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the Python dependencies required for the application, such as Flask, Flask-Login, and pymongo.
- **`Dockerfile`**: Defines the Docker image for the web app, including instructions for installing dependencies and setting up the environment.
